Pick a place, any place. To travel alone is a difficult decision for anyone, but for me, it came naturally. I made that trip to China, and then zigzagged on a multinational tour through South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Italy.<br />\n<br />\nBut the reactions I’ve gotten, from people I know, fellow travelers, and especially, from the natives of the countries I’ve visited, showed me that solo traveling is strange, and even considered inconceivable or reckless. People ask me if the isolation makes me sad or even if I’m more susceptible to violent or dangerous situations.<br />\n<br />\nTraveling solo has been sometimes a blessing, sometimes a curse. In China, I met two girls who accompanied me to my booked hotel when I had been lost for several hours, and then invited me to a feast with their friends. When they heard my next stop was their hometown, they arranged for a bilingual friend to pick me up at the train station. But there has also been the downside because of those not-so-pleasant experiences. In Indonesia, a boy menaced me, assuming I was willing to pay for his company. In Japan, I was picked up by a young man who refused to drop me at my youth hostel; he insisted I stay with his friends. The friends turned out to be four girls. I was safe, but one snored like a lawnmower, and it took me two days to escape.<br />\n<br />\nTraveling alone, other travelers can swap stories with you about the local folklore of the places they’ve been to and often have credible insights into the place you’re visiting. Locals are also more likely to see you as approachable and be upfront with you when you’re on your own. Of course, you have to be careful not to endanger yourself by throwing caution to the wind. Watch your back, but don’t presume the worst and be overly fearful. Be friendly with people, but watch out for those who are too friendly with you. Don’t disregard your instincts. If you hear stories about criminals on a road, you may take the road, but don’t take much cash, and don’t accept drinks from strangers.<br />\n<br />\nThe key to solo travel is to open your mind, close your eyes, and leap in! Everything that happens to you is an experience, and good, bad, or neutral, it will benefit you in some way. Take those little annoyances, those inefficiencies, and those boring bureaucrats with a laugh. If you despise something, just remember: You don’t live there, you can leave anytime, and you’ll never have to deal with this again!</div>","qoptionTitle":null,"qanswer":null}]}]}}
