Last time you said you felt inclined to learn Chinese but had no clue where to start. So I'm writing to recommend a place to you --- the Confucius Institute, an established language center aimed to promote Chinese language and culture.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The reasons for my recommendation are as follows. Firstly, this Chinese government-funded educational institute is staffed by the most experienced, professional Chinese teachers, which ensures high-quality instruction. You can turn to them whenever you encounter difficulties in mastering the tones and the characters. Secondly, students there are encouraged to take part in activities ranging from making traditional food to learning calligraphy, as a means of exposing them to the appealing aspects of Chinese culture. Besides, the organization is now widely embraced by more than two million students. That means you aren’t alone as a beginner and will probably forge deep friendships with other learners.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Learning a language from scratch won’t be easy.
