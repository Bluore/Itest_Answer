First, he had a unique way of making complex math concepts easy to understand . When I was confused about geometry , he used real-life objects like boxes and rulers to demonstrate theorems , which made me suddenly see the light . Second , he was always encouraging . Once I failed a crucial exam and was on the verge of giving up , he took me to his office , analyzed my mistakes patiently , and told me , \"Mistakes are just stepping stones to success . \" His words gave me the courage to keep going .\nMr. Wang's teaching and encouragement have had a lasting impact on me . He not noly taught me math but also taught me importance of perseverance . I will always remember him with great respect and gratitude .",
