Who will benefit if working from home becomes the norm?<br />\n<br />\nEmployers argue they make considerable savings on real estate when workers shift from office to home work. However, these savings result from passing costs on to workers.<br />\n<br />\nUnless employees are fully compensated, this could become a variant of <i>parasitic</i>（寄生的）capitalism, whereby corporate profits increasingly rely on extracting value from the public—and now personal—realm, rather than on generating new value.<br />\n<br />\nThough employers are backed by a chorus of remote work advocates, others note the loneliness, reduced productivity and inefficiencies of extended remote work.<br />\n<br />\nIf working from home becomes permanent, employees will have to dedicate part of their private space to work. This requires purchasing desks, chairs and office equipment.<br />\n<br />\nIt also means having private space dedicated to work: the space must be heated, cleaned, maintained and paid for. That depends on many things, but for purposes of illustration, I have run some estimates for Montreal. The exercise is simple but important, since it brings these costs out of the realm of speculation into the realm of meaningful discussion.<br />\n<br />\nRough calculations show that the savings made by employers when their staff works from home are of similar value to the compensation workers should receive for setting up offices at home.<br />\n<br />\nWhat does this mean for offices in cities? One of two things may happen: Employers pass these costs onto employees. This would be a form of <i>expropriation</i>（侵占）, with employees absorbing production costs that have traditionally been paid by the employer. This represents a considerable transfer of value from employees to employers.<br />\n<br />\nWhen employees are properly compensated, employers’ real estate savings will be modest. If savings are modest, then the many advantages of working in offices—such as lively atmosphere, rapidity of communication, team-building and <i>acclimatization</i>（适应环境）of new employees—will encourage employers to shelve the idea of remote work and, like Yahoo in 2013, encourage employees to work most of the time from corporate office space.</div>","qoptionTitle":null,"qanswer":null}]}]}}
